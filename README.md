# CSV TO JSON CONVERTER

### Made by Laura Veee

### How to Run with Node.js and Terminal

```javascript
node ./index.js
```

### What's going on here?

This is a quick and basic csv file to json converter. The converter.js function takes a path to the csv file and returns a .json file in the same project folder.

I'm planning on using terminal commands so users do not have to hard-code the csv path or the path for the resulting json file.

Small steps, baby!
